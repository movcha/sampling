# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
Understand how age influences music taste, focusing on perceptions of popular music. This information will help identify trends and differences in music preferences across different age groups and over an individual's lifetime.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Individuals of varying ages, particularly within GTA, who are willing to discuss their music preferences.
Sampling Frame: A list of residents in GTA, stratified by age groups (under 18, 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60+).
Sampling Units: Individual residents within GTA.
Observational Units: Each individual respondent to the survey.

Stratified sampling strategy should be used. The intention is to ensure that all age groups are represented in the survey, which is crucial for studying how music taste varies with age and increase the accuracy of the results by reducing sampling error within each age stratum.
Using stratified sampling, we can draw more reliable and generalizable conclusions about the relationship between age and music taste.
