| Sample type                                           | Cross-sectional design, stratified probability sampling.                                                                                           |  Two-wave panel with a modified rolling cross-section during the campaign period, followed by a post-election recontact wave.                                           |  Both field observations and laboratory experiments. The samples included individuals of the bat species Glossophaga soricina captured for the study.                                                                                           |
| Sample size                                           | Approximately 24,000 completed questionnaires from 40,000 invitations.                                                                                           | Responses from 37,262 individuals across Canada.                                            |  The specific sample size is not detailed in the documentation, but it involved multiple individuals of Glossophaga soricina.                                                                                           |
| Target population                                     | Individuals aged 15 and older in Canada's ten provinces, excluding full-time institutional residents.                                                                                           |  Canadian citizens and permanent residents aged 18 or older.                                           |  The target population was Glossophaga soricina, a nectar-feeding bat species found in Central America.                                                                                           |
| Sampling frame                                        | Combination of landline and cellular numbers from the Census and administrative sources.                                                                                           |  Online panel respondents recruited by Qualtrics, stratified by region and balanced on gender and age within each region.                                           |  Locations within the natural habitat of Glossophaga soricina in Central America, where the bats were captured for study.                                                                                           |
| Survey mode(s)                                        | Electronic questionnaire, CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing).                                                                                           | Online.                                           | Direct field observations of bat behavior and laboratory analysis, including DNA barcoding to identify insect prey.                                                                                            |
| Timeline                                              | Data collected from September 4, 2018, to December 28, 2018.                                                                                           | The survey was carried out during the campaign period and post-election period of the 2019 Canadian federal election.                                            | Published in 2013, indicating that data collection occurred prior to this date. Exact data collection periods are not specified.                                                                                            |
| Response rate                                         | 41.9%                                                                                           | Traditional response rates are not applicable for online surveys, but the re-interview rate for the post-election survey was 27.3%.                                            |  As study involves animal behavior and not human subjects, a traditional response rate metric does not apply.                                                                                           |
| Weights                                               | Weights to ensure representation, adjusted for non-response.                                                                                           | Weight variables were provided to ensure representativeness based on age, gender, education, and provincial census distributions.                                            |  Weighting is not relevant to this type of ecological and behavioral study.                                                                                           |
| Data processing                                       | Includes automated and manual edits, imputation using donor records and mean imputation.                                                                                           | Data processing involved cleaning out incomplete responses, duplicate responses, very fast completions, straight-lining in grid questions, and postal codes not matching provinces.                                            | DNA barcoding to identify insect prey items from bat fecal samples, along with behavioral observations recorded during both field and lab settings.                                                                                            |
| Cleaning, imputation, etc.                            | Multi-step imputation process                                                                                           | Cleaning involved removing incomplete or invalid responses and ensuring data integrity through checks on response times and consistency.                                            | The study likely involved standard ecological data cleaning processes, such as verifying species identification through DNA analysis and ensuring the accuracy of behavioral observations. Specific details on imputation are not provided.                                                                                            |
| Sources of error                                      | Sampling error, non-sampling error (e.g., coverage errors, non-response bias).                                                                                           | Potential sources of error include sampling error, nonresponse bias, and measurement error due to self-reported data.                                            | Potential sources of error include misidentification of insect prey through DNA barcoding and observational biases during field studies. Laboratory conditions might not fully replicate natural behaviors.                                                                                            |
| Limitations, known biases                             | Excludes households without telephones, potential undercoverage, non-response bias adjusted through weight adjustments.                                                                                           |  Limitations include the inability to calculate traditional response rates and potential biases due to the online nature of the survey, such as underrepresentation of individuals without internet access.                                           | The study acknowledges that laboratory conditions may not perfectly mimic natural environments, potentially influencing bat behavior. Additionally, the reliance on DNA barcoding could introduce biases if certain prey items are underrepresented in genetic databases.                                                                                            |
