# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

In the simulation model, the sampling procedure involves several stages with specific parameters and distributions. First, the model creates a DataFrame for 1000 individuals, dividing them into 200 attending weddings and 800 attending brunches. Next, 10% of these individuals are randomly chosen to be infected using uniform random selection without replacement. Then, 20% of the infected individuals are randomly traced based on a Bernoulli distribution. For secondary contact tracing, events with at least two traced individuals are identified, and all infected individuals at those events are traced. Finally, the proportions of infections and traces attributed to weddings are calculated for analysis.
I ran the whitby_covid_tracing.py script as it is and compared the results to the graphs from the original blog post. The graphs produced by the script are similar but not identical to the ones in the blog post. The main structure and trends are there, but there are slight variations, which is expected due to the randomness in the simulation.
Next, I modified the number of repetitions in the simulation from 50,000 to 1,000 and ran the script multiple times. The outputted graphs showed more variability with 1,000 repetitions compared to 50,000. This makes sense because a smaller sample size generally leads to more variability in the results.
To make the code reproducible, I added a random seed using np.random.seed(). This ensures that the random numbers generated by the script are the same every time it runs.
After making this change, I ran the script multiple times and observed that the outputted graphs were identical each time, ensuring reproducibility.
By setting a random seed, the script produces the same output every time it is run, which is crucial for reproducibility in simulations and analyses. This change does not need to make the output match Whitby's original blog post exactly, but it does ensure that the results are consistent across multiple runs.
